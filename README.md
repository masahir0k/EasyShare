Concept:

EasyShare is free exchange service.<br/>
Camp gear, mowing machine, etc.<br/>
Everyone has something they use not so often.<br/>
How about share and use thing free of charge?<br/>
That's the concept.<br/>

URL:<br/>
http://easyshareapp.com <br/>

Functions:<br/>
- User registration<br/>
- Posting (text, picture, map information)<br/>
- Like<br/>
- Listing of the post by the users or liked by themselves<br/>
- Post search<br/>

Procedure:<br/>
1. Post things the user can share (text, picture, location)<br/>
2. Comment to the user want to use and decide how the users exchange.<br/>
3. Exchange items<br/>
The more the user post items, the more they will have chance to use things.<br/>
Also, the users have chances to know other users that have same hobby.

Development reason:<br/>
The reason is "I wish I could use this kind of service".<br/>
Everyone has something they use couple of times or less in a year.<br/>
It's a loss to buy something used only temporary and disposed later.<br/>
It will enrich everybody's lives by sharing. <br/>
